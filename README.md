# 📊 Pricing Dashboard – Mini Project 1

Welcome to my Power BI Mini Project! This interactive dashboard visualizes pricing and sales performance data for over 345,000 transactions extracted from SAP. It's designed to showcase my data modeling, DAX, and business intelligence skills — especially in analyzing trends, contribution margin, and customer value.

## 🧠 Business Context

The data simulates a real-world manufacturing sales environment, with detailed line-level transaction data including:

- Part number (Material)
- Net sales and cost
- Sales district and territory manager
- Sold-To and End User customer groups
- Date of transaction

The goal: Provide at-a-glance KPIs and dynamic insights into **sales performance**, **margins**, and **top customers**, enabling better pricing decisions.

## 🧮 DAX Highlights

```DAX
Contribution Margin = [Total Net Sales] - [Total Order Cost]

Contribution Margin % = 
    DIVIDE([Contribution Margin], [Total Net Sales], 0)

Net Sales YTD = 
    CALCULATE([Total Net Sales], DATESYTD('DateTable'[Date]))

Net Sales QTD = 
    CALCULATE([Total Net Sales], DATESQTD('DateTable'[Date]))
```
