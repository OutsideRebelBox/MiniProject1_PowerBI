# 📊 Pricing Dashboard – Mini Project 1

Welcome to my Power BI Mini Project! This interactive dashboard visualizes pricing and sales performance data for over 345,000 transactions extracted from SAP. It's designed to showcase my data modeling, DAX, and business intelligence skills — especially in analyzing trends, contribution margin, and customer value.

## 🧠 Business Context

The data simulates a real-world manufacturing sales environment, with detailed line-level transaction data including:

- Part number (Material)

- Sales district and territory manager
- Sold-To and End User customer groups

The goal: Provide at-a-glance KPIs and dynamic insights into **sales performance**, **margins**, and **top customers**, enabling better pricing decisions.
